# Overview

This is an api that was created with Django. I made a polls "app" that takes users polls and asks a couple of silly questions. The goal I had with this project was to learn how an API works / take my very first step into using and creating API's and to learn the basics of Django. I was super excited to try making the polls work because I thought it was a fun idea and I would be able to learn while having fun. I was also able to add admin views so that I could sign in and change data in the database.
